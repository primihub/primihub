## Feature
PrimiHub is a platform that supports Multi-Party Computing(MPC), Federated Learning, Private set intersection (PSI), and Private Information Retrieval (PIR) features, and supports extensions of data source access, data consumption, access application, syntax, semantic and security protocols. For details, see PrimiHub [core feature](http://docs.primihub.com/docs/category/%E6%A0%B8%E5%BF%83%E7%89%B9%E6%80%A7).

## Quick start

Run an Multi-Party Computing application in 5 minutes

Install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/overview/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

Download the `docker-compose` file:

```shell
curl https://get.primihub.com/release/1.3.9/docker-compose.yml -s -o docker-compose.yml
```

## Run an MPC case

### Start the test nodes
   
Start three docker containers using docker-compose.
    The container includes: one simple bootstrap node, three nodes

```shell
$ docker-compose up -d
```

Check out the running docker **container**

```shell
$ docker-compose ps
```

```shell
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                                COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS          PORTS                                                                         NAMES

```                                                   

### Create an MPC task

***Let three nodes jointly perform a logistic regression task of multi-party secure computation (MPC)***

```shell
$ docker run --network=host -it primihub/primihub-node:latest ./primihub-cli --server=127.0.0.1:8050
```

> ðŸ’¡ The node response the task
>  
> You can request computing tasks from any node in the computing cluster
>

> ðŸ’¡ Available task parameters
> 
> The following parameters can be specified through primihub-cli:
>  1. Which node is requested to start the task.
>  2. Which shared datasets are used.
>  3. What kind of private computing tasks to do.
 
In this example, primihub-cli will use the default parameters to request an ABY3 tripartite logistic regression test task from ***node 0***. For the parameters that can be specified by cli, please refer to ***[Create task](https://docs.primihub.com/docs/category/%E5%88%9B%E5%BB%BA%E4%BB%BB%E5%8A%A1)***
